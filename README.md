# ml-project-credit-risk-model

Developed a Credit Risk Modeling solution to predict loan eligibility by generating a credit score based on user-provided details. Trained the model on a dataset of 50,000 rows using XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. The model predicts credit score, default probability, and assigns a risk rating to assess loan approval likelihood.

Tools: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, XG-Boost, Optuna
